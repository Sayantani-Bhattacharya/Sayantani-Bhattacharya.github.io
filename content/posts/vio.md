## Overview

This is an ongoing research project in collaboration with the **[SeNSE Lab at Northwestern University](https://sense-lab.github.io/)** with the aim to embody the sensory-motor loop of seal to understand the cognitive effects of the percieved data from the wiskers. 

So, I am developing an Underwater ROV system with seal-inspired whiskers' array mounting, to emulate the perception information observed by Seals in real life and develop decision making model based on that information. The final objective is to build an ROV capable of autonomously persuing a moving object, underwater, based solely on wiskers' perception.

## System-Architechture 

## ROS Package/Node, Concurrency stuff

## Stereo
## RANSAC
## Pose-Estimate
## g2o
## ORB/SIFT
## Mono/Stereo



## Futute Work:
1. Used ML Based techques and use this as a benchmark to test.
2. Deploy on edge devices.
