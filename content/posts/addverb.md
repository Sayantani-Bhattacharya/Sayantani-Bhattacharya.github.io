**Robotics Engineer**  
*Full-time*  
**Aug 2023 – Jun 2024 · 11 mos**

- Developed and conducted first-round testing of the Behaviour Tree, Task Scheduler, Assignment, and hardware client's TCP interface modules for the AMR fleet.
- Responsible for client demos for the fleet system and remote site support.
- Worked on heuristic, graph-based, and linear programming-based solutions for multi-agent path-finding problems.
- Developed modules for velocity profiling, simulated WCS pipeline, topological feature extraction, path-follower, Bézier curves, and simulated motion model for the AGV Fleet.
- Refactored code sections to enhance performance and reduce computation time.

**Mobile Robotics GET**  
*Aug 2022 – Jul 2023 · 1 yr*

- Developed an end-to-end module using MILP (Mixed Integer Linear Programming) for deadlock avoidance and priority-based robot-task assignment for the MPV (Mobile Picking Vehicle) Fleet (C++), integrated into the fleet stack.
- Built the entire MPV Fleet simulation configurator from scratch with the Product Team (Python, PyQt, NetworkX), reducing Sales Dept. throughput estimation from 2 days to 3 hours.
- Generated throughput simulations for AGVs based on specific client requirements for the Sales team.
