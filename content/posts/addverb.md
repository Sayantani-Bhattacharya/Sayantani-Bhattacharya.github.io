**Mobile Robotics GET**  
*Aug 2022 – Jul 2023 · 1 yr*

- Developed an end-to-end module using MILP (Mixed Integer Linear Programming) for deadlock avoidance and priority-based robot-task assignment for multi-carton picking robot (MPV) fleet using C++ and lp solver.
- Built the entire MPV Fleet operation simulation tool from scratch with the Product Team (Python, PyQt), reducing throughput estimation time from 2 days to 3 hours.
- Generated throughput simulations for AGVs based on specific client requirements for the Sales team.
