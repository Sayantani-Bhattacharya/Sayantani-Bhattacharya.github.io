In this project, the Franka arm searches for known randomly placed pins and shoots them down. The Franka arm is fitted with an onboard camera to search its environment and two Nerf blasters to be able to shoot the targets. There are two rounds of shooting, while during each rounds, the user can verbally specify colors of the pins that the arm is going to shoot and the Franka arm will pick up one gun to shoot all the designate colored pins at the environment.
